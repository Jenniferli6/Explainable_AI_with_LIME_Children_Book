## 🌟 Introduction

Hi! I created a children’s book called **[Explainable AI with LIME](https://read.bookcreator.com/wwn949hLXZQB5eg3oCeTNQX6EE12/5oPBAcmWQBi1lcLdgpIr1Q/6Qs8XEpqRburT_juGpbr3A)**, to introduce an important XAI technique **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** in a fun, visual, and human-centered way.

## 💡 Why This Project

When we talk about explainable AI techniques, we often focus on the algorithms or model outputs, but not on how people actually understand those explanations. However, an explanation has little value if the user cannot truly understand it. 

This gap inspired me to explore how we can make complex AI concepts **clear, understandable, and emotionally engaging**. Therefore, I decided to try explaining an important XAI technique **LIME**, using simple language, playful characters, and visual metaphors in **children’s story**, to shown **human-centered design in AI**.

## 🎨 Book Overview

“Explainable AI with LIME” is a fun and colorful children’s storybook that introduces readers to the concept of LIME in Explainable AI through an engaging adventure with:

- Mia — a curious kid who loves to ask why.
- Robo — a friendly robot who makes decisions but doesn’t provide explanation
- LIME — a cheerful green character who helps make Robo’s thinking transparent, by building a simpler, easy-to-understand Mini-Robo, to show how and why Robo makes his decisions.
- Mini-Robo — a small transparent robot

Together, they explore how smart machines make decisions with LIME technique.
