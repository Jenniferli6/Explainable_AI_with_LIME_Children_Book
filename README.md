# Explainable AI with LIME

Hi! I created a children’s book called **Explainable AI with LIME** ([read it here](https://read.bookcreator.com/wwn949hLXZQB5eg3oCeTNQX6EE12/5oPBAcmWQBi1lcLdgpIr1Q/6Qs8XEpqRburT_juGpbr3A)), to introduce an important XAI technique — **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** — in a fun, visual, and human-centered way.

When we talk about explainable AI techniques, we often focus on the algorithms or model outputs, but not on how people actually understand those explanations. However, an explanation has little value if the user cannot truly understand it. 

Therefore, I decided to translate XAI concepts into a **children’s story**, using storytelling and visual analogy to make them approachable and understandable. My goal was to simplify the LIME method and highlight the importance of **human-centered design in AI**, where explanations are not just accurate but also meaningful to their audience.
